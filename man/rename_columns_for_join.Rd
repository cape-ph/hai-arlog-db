\title{Rename Columns for Data Frame Join}
\usage{
rename_columns_for_join(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame with at least three columns. The first and third
columns are selected and renamed.}
}
\value{
A data frame with only the first and third columns, renamed to
\code{"Keys"} and \code{"Values"}.
}
\description{
This function selects the first and third columns from a data frame and
renames them to \code{"Keys"} and \code{"Values"}, respectively. This is typically
used to prepare the data frame for a join operation where these columns
serve as the key-value pairs.
}
\examples{
df <- data.frame(A = 1:3,
                 B = letters[1:3],
                 C = c("X", "Y", "Z"),
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
renamed_df <- rename_columns_for_join(df)
# renamed_df will have two columns: 'Keys' (from column A) and
# 'Values' (from column C)
